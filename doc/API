$common::genheap{ -255 }
	General storage area for kernel-related stuff. Probably shouldn't
	mess with this too much. -255 can be passed to some functions
	(noteably e_log()) to tell that a message is coming from the kernel
	itself, and not a particular client.

$common::genheap{ Wheel_ID }{ address }
	Contains the IP address of a connected client

$common::genheap{ Wheel_ID }{ uname }
	Contains the user's handle. This should be considered read-only.

$common::genheap{ Wheel_ID }{ seq }
	Contains the user's unique seq number, retrieved from the MySQL
	database.

$common::genheap{ Wheel_ID }{ priv }
	Contains the user's privilege level. Anything higher than 90 is
	considered to be sysop-level.

$common::genheap{ Wheel_ID }{ fn }
	Contains the user's first name, if given

$common::genheap{ Wheel_ID }{ ln }
	Contains the user's first name, if given

$common::genheap{ Wheel_ID }{ intime }
	Contains an array reference to when the user logged in. This should
	not be messed with.

$common::genheap{ Wheel_ID }{ where }
	Contains what to display in the public "Who's Online". If this is
	not set, the user will be effectively 'hidden' from public view.

$common::state{ Wheel_ID }
	This is the internal 'state', by which the main application directs
	input to modules by. Example: if a user's state is 'main_screen',
	their input would get directed to main_screen::run().

$heap->{ disco }{ Wheel_ID }
	When this is defined, the client will be disconnected after all
	pending output has been flushed to it.
